The technique, named PagedAttention, aims to address the challenge of high memory consumption associated with large language models by introducing a paging mechanism that allows for the dynamic loading and unloading of model parameters. This approach seeks to optimize the trade-off between memory usage and computational performance, making it feasible to serve large language models on hardware with limited memory resources."}

By processing multiple requests simultaneously, the model can share the overhead of loading and inference across several inputs, leading to better throughput and lower latency per request. This approach also allows for more efficient use of hardware accelerators, such as GPUs or TPUs, which are designed to perform parallel computations. As a result, batching helps in achieving the high-performance requirements necessary for serving LLMs at scale."}

This can lead to struggles in system performance when the memory is managed inefficiently, as the system must handle the large and fluctuating memory footprint for each request, which requires careful batching and coordination."}
